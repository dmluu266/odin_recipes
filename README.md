# odin_recipes
### Introduction:
The recipe I will use for the odin_recipes project is "Fiery Fish Tacos." The project tasks me with
creating a recipe page where I will demonstrate the basics that I've learned so far.
### Reflection:
This project was good practice for the basics and syntax that I've learned so far. I also learned how to
write fractions in html as some of the recipe ingredients were in fractions.
